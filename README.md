# Chess-Codes

This Chess Project is my first major programming project, built to improve my understanding of core programming concepts, logical thinking, and basic frontend–backend interaction. The goal was not to create an advanced chess engine, but to learn by coding, experimenting, and solving real development problems.

This is my first solo project though it is not perfect too much only it has legal moves of each peice still i am working on it too make it much perfect and precise.It was not easy to make this chess programmer. 

## Features
- Basic chess board UI
- Valid move highlighting
- Turn-based play (White vs Black)

## Future Improvements
- Implement check and checkmate logic
- Add move history
- Improve UI and responsiveness
