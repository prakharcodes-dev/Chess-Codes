# Chess-Codes

This is my first solo project, and although it is not fully complete yet, it currently supports legal moves for all chess pieces. I am continuously working on improving the logic and overall accuracy of the game. Building this project helped me understand that implementing chess logic is more challenging than it appears.

## Features
- Basic chess board UI
- Valid move highlighting
- Turn-based play (White vs Black)

## Future Improvements
- Implement check and checkmate logic
- Add move history
- Improve UI and responsiveness

## 🛣️ Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned improvements for the project as my skills grow.

### Planned Features
- Detect check and checkmate conditions
- Prevent illegal moves automatically
- Add move history panel
- Add game restart and reset option

### Long-Term Goals
- Improve UI design
- Add basic AI opponent
- Optimize game logic
